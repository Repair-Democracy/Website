## About Us
We are a small group of friends who, after the 2024 election, began sharing ideas for resisting the rise of authoritarianism in our country. 

As a first project, we created this t&#8209;shirt to raise funds for the ACLU,
a steadfast defender of the rights of all Americans for decades, through litigation and education.

## Our Project
### Because democracy can't repair itself, we speak, vote, and resist.

Today, the ACLU works to defend the rights of immigrants and LGBTQIA2S+ people, restore an independent judiciary, fight for racial justice and women’s health care, and protect the First Amendment.

The shirts are ivory on dark gray, 100% cotton, made in the US, and printed at a union shop. Five dollars from the sale of each shirt (everything beyond the production cost) goes to the ACLU.

If you would like one of your own, the **{{ page.button_label }}** button will take you to our printer's site where you can place an order.

And if t-shirts aren’t your thing, consider [donating to the ACLU][aclu-donate] anyway. Their expertise and tireless commitment inspire us in our goal of repairing our democracy.
