As part of our search to find effective ways to resist and to support those who had, we created this t-shirt to raise funds for the [ACLU][aclu], which has defended the rights of all Americans for decades through litigation and education. Their work today includes defending the rights of immigrants and LBGBTQ+ people, preserving an independent judiciary, fighting for racial justice and women’s health care, and protecting the First Amendment.

If you would like one of your own, [click here to go to the order page][order].

100% of all proceeds (beyond the production costs) will go directly to the ACLU. The shirts are 100% cotton, made in the US, and printed at a union shop.

And if t-shirts aren’t your thing, consider [donating to the ACLU][aclu-donate] anyway. Their expertise and tireless commitment inspire us in our goal of repairing our democracy.
