As part of our effort to find effective ways to resist the onslaught of attacks on democracy, we have created this t-shirt to raise funds for the [ACLU][aclu].
The ACLU has been a steadfast defender the rights of all Americans for decades through litigation and education. Their work today includes defending the rights of immigrants and LBGBTQ+ people, preserving an independent judiciary, fighting for racial justice and women’s health care, and protecting the First Amendment.

100% of all proceeds (beyond the production costs) go directly to the ACLU. The shirts are 100% cotton, made in the US, and printed at a union shop.

If you would like one of your own, [click here to go to our printer's site where you can place an order][order].

And if t-shirts aren’t your thing, consider [donating to the ACLU][aclu-donate] anyway. Their expertise and tireless commitment inspire us in our goal of repairing our democracy.
