## About Us
We are a small group of friends who, after the 2024 election, began sharing ideas for resisting the policies and actions of the extremists attacking our democracy. 

## Our Project
As part of this work we created a t-shirt to raise funds for the [ACLU][aclu].
The ACLU has been a steadfast defender of the rights of all Americans for decades through litigation and education.

Their work today includes defending the rights of immigrants and LGBTQIA2S+ people, restoring an independent judiciary, fighting for racial justice and women’s health care, and protecting the First Amendment.

The shirts are made in the US and printed at a union shop. They are dark gray ("asphalt") with an ivory-colored design, 100% cotton, and cost $24.99 – out of which five dollars (everything beyond the production cost) goes to the ACLU.

If you would like one of your own, the **Order a Shirt** button will take you to our printer's site where you can place an order.

And if t-shirts aren’t your thing, consider [donating to the ACLU][aclu-donate] anyway. Their expertise and tireless commitment inspire us in our goal of repairing our democracy.
