  "As our first project, we created a shirt design to encourage grassroots activism and to raise funds for the ACLU, a&nbsp;steadfast defender of the rights of all Americans for decades, through litigation and education.

  The ACLU works to defend the rights of immigrants and LGBTQIA2S+ people, restore an independent judiciary, fight for racial justice and women’s health care, and protect the First Amendment."

Our shirts are 100% cotton, made in the US, and printed at a union shop. Five dollars from the sale of each shirt (everything beyond the production cost) goes to the ACLU.

If you would like one of your own, the **{{ page.product_button_label }}** button will take you to our printer's site where you can place an order.

And if shirts and hoodies aren’t your thing, consider [donating to the ACLU][aclu-donate] anyway. Their expertise and tireless commitment inspire us in our goal of repairing our democracy.
